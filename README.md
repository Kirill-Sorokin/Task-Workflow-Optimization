# Task Workflow Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains Python code designed to optimise task workflows in a manufacturing or processing environment. The script analyses various task paths to determine the most efficient sequence of operations and assigns tasks to workstations to balance the workload and minimise total processing time.

## Features
- Path Analysis: Evaluates all possible paths from multiple starting tasks to completion.
- Optimal Path Identification: Determines the most efficient paths based on total time, tool variety, and standard deviation.
- Workstation Assignment: Allocates tasks to workstations, ensuring an even distribution of workload.
- Top Paths Selection: Showcases the top 10 optimal paths and their corresponding workstation assignments.

## Usage
The script is ideal for operations managers, engineers, and professionals involved in process optimisation. It can be adapted to various industrial, manufacturing, or production settings where task scheduling is critical.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and run the `excelSheet4.py` script in a Python environment.
